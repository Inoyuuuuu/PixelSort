A java project that sorts pixel based on brightness (customizable) with reverse mergesort (or other algorithms if implemented) and displays an animation afterwards that shows the process of the algorithm sorting the pixels. This project was made in Processing 4.



The image can be selected by changing the name of the the "imageName" variable.\\

Image names and sizes:

\- bee = 200x200

\- catS = 300x300

\- fish = 500x500

\- cat = 600x600

\- foxS = 600x600

\- flowers = 800x800

\- butterfly = 800x1200

\- frog = 800x1200

\- fox = 1300x1300

\- kingfisher = 2200x2200





The sorting crtiteria can be adjusted via the value of "sortCriteria":

\- 0 brightness

\- 1 HUE

\- 2 saturation

\- 3 red value

\- 4 blue value

\- 5 green value
